# Class Assignment 1

## Introduction

The goal of this class assignment was to use or personal repositories and use a basic spring application to introduce new features and introduce the concept of branches and merging. Although the features are simple, the goal is to understand the process of creating a branch, adding new features, and merging the branch back into the main branch.
